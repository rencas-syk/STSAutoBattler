# STSAutoBattler
My old (now removed) AutoBattle mod for Slay The Spire. <br>
Based on [FrostPrime's AutoBattler video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyHDG7M8wmo) <br>
Similar mods were created by [Ocean](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2893878944) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/OceanUwU/autospire) and [kiooeht](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2893894998).


## Features
General: Cards can't be played normally. Cards will instead be played automatically. Created cards will also autoplay. You can end your tourn at any point (to prevent softlock). <br>
Additionally you can choose between two gameplay modes in the in-game mod settings: <br>
1. (default) Any card drawn will be immediately autoplayed. <br>
   Disables Unceasing Top <br>
   Status and Curse cards will not autoplay (will be put into your hand normally)
2. Mimic Mayhem's behaviour: Keep your drawn cards in your hand and then play as many cards from the top of your draw pile every turn. (scales with amount drawn, e.g. snecko-eye) <br>
   Identical to how the Mayhem card fucntions.

The entire mod can also be disabled in the mod settings if you don't want to repeatedly disable/reenable the mod.
